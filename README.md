# cpp-projects

This is a repository for my small personal projects. Bigger projects will be put into individual repositories created and focused just for that project.
I will be tracking the whole experience with C++ here, starting with no knowledge or C++ coding experience. In the beggining I might post some very simple
and easy programs, but still I have to start somewhere. Program complexity will grow over time.
